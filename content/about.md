# The Mission

"Is the Market Cheap?" was born out of a simple frustration: financial news is noisy, emotional, and short-term.

We wanted a dashboard that answers one question: **How far are we from the top?**

This tool aggregates data for Crypto, ETFs, and Commodities to provide a unified view of market discounts. It is open-source, free, and built for transparency.

## Open Source

This project is built with **Next.js**, **Material UI**, and deployed on **Vercel**. 
The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jonugartemoso/test-isthemarketcheap) for audit and contribution.
