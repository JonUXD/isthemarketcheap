# The Mission

"Is the Market Cheap?" was born out of a simple frustration: we could not find a place where we could see an asset price relative to its all time high. We wanted a simple, at a glance view to track the most important assets for long time investors.

It is proven that doing value averaging is more profitable than dollar cost averaging, and this could be a good way to adjust your monthly contributions into your assets and commodities based on the KPI shown on this page.
