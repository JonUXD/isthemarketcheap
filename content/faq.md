## What is the purpose of this page?
The purpose is to provide a clear, unbiased signal of assets that are trading at a significant discount relative to their historical peak. In a world of noise, 'Price below All-Time High' is a simple, factual metric of cheapness.

## Why 'Percent Below ATH' Methodology?
All-Time High (ATH) represents the maximum price the market was once willing to pay for an asset. Measuring the distance from that peak is a classic way to identify potential value. However, 'Cheap' does not always mean 'Good'. Some assets are down for a reason.

## Why do assets go up in value?
Over the long term, productive assets (like stocks) tend to appreciate due to economic growth, innovation, and corporate earnings. Scarce assets (like Gold or Bitcoin) may appreciate due to monetary debasement and supply constraints.

## Is inflation taken into account?
Currently, no. The prices are nominal terms (USD). A drop of 20% in nominal terms might be a drop of 25% or more in real purchasing power terms depending on the timeframe.

## What happens with very volatile assets?
Volatile assets (like Crypto) frequently experience -50% to -80% drawdowns. A 20% drop in Bitcoin is common noise, whereas a 20% drop in the S&P 500 is a major correction. We plan to add a 'Volatility Grade' in the future to help distinguish these scenarios.
